Project Notes

This app helps a group of friends choose a resturant. Using the Yelp API. the user makes a couple of filter selections, such as city and price. The app then uses those filters to retrieve data from the Yelp API and presents these one at a time in a tinder-like fashion. Swipe left to discard a suggestion, swipe right to add to your list of possibilities. Once 4 possible resturants are in their list, they can pick themselves and the app can choose for them.

API: YELP
Database: Users can create an account or continue as a guest. If they are users, then we can store their history and not show them resturants they have previously rejected, or clear their history and start fresh.
